Quality damage at the very beginning is acceptable because I'm used to videos taking a few seconds to smooth out after loading. Damage in the middle is the worse because it interrupts the flow and experience of the cars racing through the track. When there were no cars on screen, I couldn't tell if the video had froze. The experiment was clear and there was no confusion.
