The pauses during passes of the ball would be one area where the experience is different. You might miss a critical pass or block. Guidelines were fine, I felt like it was a matter of taste as to how "much" the degrading annoyed me. The attention check was fine, though it felt a little dirty seeing a pause at the beginning of the video; I don't think that was exactly fair.
