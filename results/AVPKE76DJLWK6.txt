I think if the quality changes during a sequence where the cars are not in action; just a shot of the track, it is less of an irritation than when degradation occurs while the car is the focus. I found all these videos to be only fair as there is at least one moment in them all where the video goes all pearshaped. I found the guidelines clear.
