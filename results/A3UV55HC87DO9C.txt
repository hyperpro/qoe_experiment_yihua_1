Damage during important moments like when a player is about to score is very annoying. It's a lot worse during these crucial moments compared to some poor quality in the beginning or a few pauses. It was very annoying when the quality would degrade right around when someone was near the goal. Couldn't even tell what was going on. The experiment was clear. I didn't have an issue with the format or attention checks.
